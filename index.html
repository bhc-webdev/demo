    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The origins of Santa Claus can be traced back to the real historical figure of Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century Greek bishop known for his generosity and love for children. Born in the ancient city of Patara, he became the Bishop of Myra and was renowned for his acts of kindness. Over time, his story evolved, blending with various cultural traditions to create the modern image of Santa Claus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many cultures, Saint Nicholas was celebrated as a protector of children and sailors, with numerous legends recounting his miracles and good deeds. One famous story tells of how he secretly provided dowries for three poor sisters, saving them from a life of poverty. This act of secret gift-giving laid the foundation for the tradition of Santa Claus.

    <p>
      In the 19th century, the poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (commonly known as "The Night Before Christmas") and the illustrations of Haddon Sundblom for Coca-Cola helped to shape the contemporary portrayal of Santa Claus. These depictions solidified the image of Santa as a jolly, rotund man with a red suit, white beard, and a sack full of toys. Today, Santa Claus is a <strong>universal</strong> symbol of Christmas joy and goodwill, appearing in countless holiday movies, advertisements, and decorations.
